Changes in v1.07
================

o Fixed a bug in RaiseAlarm() that caused a FE if the timer that was
  kicking in had an empty description.

o You can now tell TikTok that you want timers to stop counting when
  they are acting as an alarm and they go off. See the options dialog
  for the setting (thanks to Kadar Tanuwidjaja <ktan8@dgs.monash.edu.au>
  for the patch that this change is based on).

o You can now tell TikTok to use a timers last starting time when you
  tick it on a second time. See the options dialog for the setting
  (thanks to Kadar Tanuwidjaja <ktan8@dgs.monash.edu.au> for the patch
  that this change is based on).

Changes in v1.06
================

o Minor tweaks to the prefs structures to reduce the memory needed to
  hold the timer details.

o Improved the look of the interface (thanks to J. Y. Mantinband
  <yosh@netvision.net> for the suggestions).

o Added "zero timer" options to the Clear menu.

o Added a "quick alarms" menu.

o Added an extra config option that lets you tell TikTok that you
  don't want to be asked silly questions when you say you want to
  clear/zero all timers.

o Added an optional clock display (thanks to Holger Klawitter
  <holger@math.uni-muenster.de> for the suggestion).

Changes in v1.05
================

o PilotMain() now returns sysErrParamErr if the cmd is not known or used
  by TikTok (source: <syK3zYbo8GA.74@darrin2.massena.com> in
  pilot.programmer.gcc on news.massena.com).

o Many tweaks to the code to try and kill the menu-death-bug.

o Moved to GCC 0.5.0. It appears that 0.4.0 was the cause of the
  menu-death-bug.

Changes in v1.04
================

o Removed the input filter on the time fields. Next time I'll think
  things thru a lot better before I add something like this. :-)

Changes in v1.03
================

o Corrected a couple of minor bugs which shouldn't have been user
  visible but were bad coding.

o When writing in the "time" field, all characters that are not
  "0-9:." are ignored.

Changes in v1.02
================

o Corrected a couple of spelling mistakes.

o All time fields are now editable.

o If a user enters a negative value in a time field it is considered to
  be a countdown timer and will trip an alarm when it hits 0.

o Added options form that allows you to specify if alarms should just
  be audible or visible as well.

o You can now use the Pilot's up/down keys to start and stop a timer 
  (both keys work the same, they toggle the currently focused timer).
