Welcome to TikTok.

TikTok is designed to be a simple, no nonsense, timer utility. Using
it is dead simple. Tick on a tickbox to start a timer, edit it's
description to tell you what it is you are timing. Simple! There are a
couple of other features, tap on the (I) icon for full help.

The application ID 'DAP2' is registered with USR. If you intend to
make changes and release your own free version based on this code
please make sure you change the application ID.

Please note that I'm releasing TikTok as free software, licensed under
the GPL. Be sure to read the file COPYING for full details.

If you have any feedback or comments (or bugs) please feel free to
mail them to tiktok@hagbard.demon.co.uk (please use this address
instead of my personal address as this helps me in sorting my mail and
it will result in you getting a better response). Before you do mail
me with any questions and/or bugs, please read the FAQ file first,
your question may already have been answered.

Also, if you would like to join in on discussions about TikTok with
other TikTok users you may want to join the tiktok-users mailing
list. To join the list send a message to:

	majordomo@hagbard.demon.co.uk

and in the body of the message (NOTE, that's the body of the message,
NOT the subject) type:

	subscribe tiktok-users

The list gets pretty much 0 traffic, but I do use it to announce new
versions and the like. So, don't worry, it won't flood your mailbox.

The latest version of TikTok will always be available from:

        http://www.acemake.com/hagbard/
or
        http://www.hagbard.demon.co.uk/

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of TikTok you can find
out what has changed by reading the Changes file.

Have fun.
