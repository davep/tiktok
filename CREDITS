Thanks go to the following people who have mailed bug reports and
suggestions or have submitted code during the development of TikTok:

o Andrew Robertson <Andrew_Robertson@compuserve.com>
  
  Alerted me to my terrible abuse of my native language in the tips
  screen.

o Jim Aspnes <aspnes@cs.yale.edu>

  Submitted a patch to allow countdown timers with alarms. This patch
  formed the basis of the countdown ability of v1.02. Also gave lots
  of support and ideas when I was getting stuck with bits and bobs.

o Iain Barclay <isb@pobox.com>

  Help and ideas and was good enough to read and reply to my mail
  while I was attempting to get my head around various bits of Pilot
  coding. He also runs the excellent RoadCoders web site (check it
  out at http://www.roadcoders.com/) and is the author of the (IMHO) 
  #1 timer application, BugMe!

o J. Y. Mantinband <yosh@netvision.net>

  Thanks for sticking with 1.05 and testing each release above and
  beyound the call of duty.

o Andrew Ball <aball@icis.on.ca>

  For helping me work out if the menu-death-bug was a problem with the
  compiler and for patching TikTok to work with 0.5.0. Andy is also
  the author of the excellent Chronos, if you want a serious stopwatch,
  clock and countdown timer you should check out Chronos.

o Holger Klawitter <holger@math.uni-muenster.de>

  For the clock display suggestion.

o Kadar Tanuwidjaja <ktan8@dgs.monash.edu.au>

  For a patch that added the "timer memory" and "halting alarms"
  features.
