Here are some of the things, in no special order, that I intend to get
round to doing at some time in the near future.

o Flexible config per timer.

o Nicer looking interface?

o A better icon (any artists out there want to do one?).

o Make the quick alarms menu configurable.

o Add some patches for extra features that I've been sent (apologies to
  those who have, I'm a little short on time at the moment).

o Documentation.
