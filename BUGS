o Now and again the active timers in TikTok appear to "stop". I've
  found that coming out of and going back into TikTok will start
  them up again (no time is lost). It looks like the Pilot OS has
  stopped sending nilEvent events to the application for some reason.

o Sometimes, when using the menu shortcuts, the interface can get into
  a bit of a mess (this is really only a problem for the timer that is
  at the bottom).
