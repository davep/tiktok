TikTok FAQ:

1. Is there any chance of adding feature X?

   Possibly. Mail me with your suggestion and I'll consider it. I can't
   guarantee that I'll add it, but, if I like it, if it can be done and
   if I can do it and it makes sense for TikTok I'll probably add it.

   Failing that, you have the source code.... :-)

2. Can I register TikTok?

   No, TikTok is free software, read the file COPYING for full details.
   However, if you do feel the need to send someone some money why not
   consider making a donation to the Free Software Foundation? Pop over
   to http://www.fsf.org/ to find out about them.

3. Can I modify and distribute my own version of TikTok?

   Read the file COPYING for a full answer to this question.

4. Alarms appear to kick in up to 60 seconds late!

   This is a known "problem" with the Pilot. If your Pilot is turned
   on an alarm should fire right on time. However, if your Pilot is
   turned off an alarm can kick in up to 60 seconds late. From what
   I've seen most software that uses alarms suffers from this. I'm
   afraid there is nothing I can do about this, it appears to be the
   way the Pilot works.

5. Why can't I time things down to 100th of a second?

   Because TikTok is not designed to do that. It's designed to be
   a simple, pretty accurate, stopwatch utility. I'd not advise that
   you time any critical event. I wrote TikTok to time things where
   a couple of seconds here and there don't matter (that's not to say
   that TikTok is that sloppy).
   
   If you want a stopwatch that can go down to 100th of a second I'd
   suggest you take a look at Chronos (check your local Pilot software
   library for full details).
